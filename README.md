# React Gallery

## Description

This is a React CRUD app that allows a user to input their own image from a url (or add an image to the project if they have access) and provide a description. Each image has a like counter for others to view and 'like' as well as a remove function for images that the user wants to delete.

## Usage
Have you ever wanted to display your photos and get feedback from people on which photos look the best? Here is a great way to display your images and get them set up.
